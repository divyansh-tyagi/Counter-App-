# Counter-App-
This is my first ever project, A counter Application made using basic HTML CSS and JS. In this Application, we have 3 buttons as '+','-' and 'reset', + increases the value of default no. 0 by 1, minus decreases the value by 1 and reset makes the value default again, the default value can not go in negative terms, it will stay  >=0.
